# Linear Regression from Scratch using Gradient Descent and Analytical Methods

Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables).
The relationships are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data. A simple/univariate linear predictior functions assumes following form 
### Simple Linear Regression Formulae ###
> _yi = a0+a1X + e where e is small error_

As the name suggests univariate meaning single independent variable, here **_X_** is single independent variable which modeled using formulae mentioned above to predict single dependent variable **_y_**.

There are multiple methods to create a simple linear regression model, this github project makes use of following methods for simple linear regression:
> Simple linear regression using analytical methods
        1) Simple linear regression using mean/averages.
        2) Simple linear regression using standard deviation and correlation. 
> Simple linear regression using gradient descent
